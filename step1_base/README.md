## RUN THE SAMPLE

    1.  In a terminal, navigate to this sample's root directory.

    2.  Run the following commands:

        gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID

        Where PROJECT_ID is the project ID for the project you created when you registered for
        Business Messages

        mvn appengine:deploy

    3.  On your mobile device, use the test business URL associated with the
        Business Messages agent you created. Open a conversation with your agent
        and type in "Hello". Once delivered, you should receive "Hello" back
        from the agent.
